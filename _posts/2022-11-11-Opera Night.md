title: La Traviata at SF Opera House
---
This is my first time watching opera in person. [La Traviata](https://www.sfopera.com/operas/la-traviata/#videos), is adopted and composed by Giuseppe Verdi, and it is one of the most performed opera. Other pieces recommended by Augustin and Sun include Mozart's pieces(Magic Flute), 
Turandot by Giacomo Puccini and Aida by Giuseppe Verdi.

#### Pic2 Act II, Scene I
This is where Giorgio Germont persuade Violetta to leave Alfredo. I was impressed by the ingenous usage of light (observe how the morning light shines in as Germont gain confidence that their family will be saved).

#### Pic3 Ending
As a tradition, audience applauds nonstop untill the curtain was drawn and could last for dozens of minitues. A very eyeopening experience.
