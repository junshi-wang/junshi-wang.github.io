title: Thanksgiving Road Trip Blog

I am a big fan of nature and museums. And America, being very famous for its abundant and well-preserved national parks and diverse art and history museums, is a perfect place for me. In this blog, I will take you with me onto a 5-day road trip journey, from Monterey to Las Vegas, along the Death Valley and Yosemite, then back to Berkeley. This trip was not expected at all and I didn't initiate it. I am very thankful that my friends were kind enough to invite me and share the joy with me. 

#### Day1 Monterey

Together with Dylan, Honey and Sun, we set out at around 7 am from Bowles Hall. Music is indispensiable for a sucessful road trip. As of a matter of fact, we played Korean and Japanese songs to pay tributes to the football teams at World Cup. In about two and a half hours, we arrived at the world-class Monterey Aquarium (The ticket was quite expensive, at $50 per cap). But it did not let me down. Starting at the tank with sea otters, we visited "Open Sea", "Deep Sea", "Kelp Forest", "Octupus", "Pengiums" and "Touch Pond". In terms of level of amazement, Open sea and Deep sea are the best. I have never seen such magnificent school of sardine and sharks and that was my first time observing the elegant movement of omninous Jellyfishes. The feeling of seeing glowing light in the darkness as the transparent creatures dancing in the water could be described as breathtaking.

#### Pic2 Act II, Scene I
This is where Giorgio Germont persuade Violetta to leave Alfredo. I was impressed by the ingenous usage of light (observe how the morning light shines in as Germont gain confidence that their family will be saved).

#### Pic3 Ending
As a tradition, audience applauds nonstop untill the curtain was drawn and could last for dozens of minitues. A very eyeopening experience.
