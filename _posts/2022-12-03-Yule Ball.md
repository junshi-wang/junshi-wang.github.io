This is my first time "really" participating in an American party (actually I joined the Dance & Disco). 

But an accident happened -- Cristina fell from 6F to 3F. The picture would stuck in my mind for a long time. However, the discussion later provided some food for thought. I wrote this experience in my diary. 
It seems that people are reluctant to admit the role of alcohol in this incident and are strongly opposed to the idea of banning underage drinking. Arguably, this would indeed do very little, but in general it will prevent big accident like this from happening. 

Max raised the point of "individual has the freedom to choose whether he/she will take up a risk". 

I questioned this "freedom" by saying that this idea of freedom to drink is a trick played by some commercial stakeholders. People are typically not aware of what risk they are taking up. 

Max countered by claiming that linking alcohol with freedom is a common phenomenon, not just American.
