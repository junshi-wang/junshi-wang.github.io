title: Washington EA Global 2022-09-23/25

First time attending a large Conference or social event like this. It was on a weekend, when I flew to Washington with newly met friends from EA Berkeley for this exciting event. Talked to a lot of people. One of them was quant researcher/trader who made millions. We were both thrilled to get into ML research. However now I am doing quant as well. How hillarious.
