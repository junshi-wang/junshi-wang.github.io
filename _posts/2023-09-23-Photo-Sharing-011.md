I with to Basel (at the junction of French, German and Swiss boarder) and Mulhouse (a French town near the boarder) with liberalist during a weekend. Now looking back, it was such a nice experience.

### Basel Art Museum
The first thing we did was to visit the famous Basel art museum.

We visited this city hall of Mulhouse. It surprisingly maintains the vibe of ancient Rome.
