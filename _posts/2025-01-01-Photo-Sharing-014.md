Some selected photos for the journey to Phu Soi Dao, on the boarder of Laos and Thailand, to celebrate New Year's Eve.

### Pic 1 Grand Palace
The Grand Palace is very stunning, especially the Emerald Temple. I never thought of something so delicate and splendid. Only fault is that probably the place is not of the same scale to that in Peking, the forbidden city. Every temple in Thailand are so glorious but small.

### Pic 2 Wat Arun
Also known as the Temple of Dawn, it is the capital of the Ayutthaya Dynasty. Impressive details and craftsmanship.

### Pic 3 Last Sunset of 2024
It was cold, chilly. But everyone kept on waiting and shivering, for this wonder to appear for its last time in 2024. A time for reflection and prayer.

### Pic 4 Pitch Fire
Speaking of prayer. Nothing would surpass the magnificance of pitch fire. In a cold dark night, fire is the item of worship. I was completely obsessed by its power, unique glory and heartwarming heat. No wonder why the ancient would worship fire, let alone the sun. Everything changed after the sun went down.

### Pic 5 Milky-way, Stars
I'd really like put up a perfect photograph of shining stars but I can't unfortunately. The modern technology such as mobile photo camera can not capture 1% of its true but mysterious outlook behind the dark veil. Only those who have seen stars, hundreds of stars, would understanding why stars blink and why people count stars. (According to the guide, Phu meanings mountain and 'Soi Dao' refers to a place that is close to the stars). Hopefully I could cast the scenary in my mind and still remember them in my nighty dreams.
